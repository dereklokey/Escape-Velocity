Can you help me write a book?  I have the following setting information.  
Setting
In the distant future, humans are one of many species coexisting in a galactic society.  Most species have leaned heavily into AI and body augmentation in order to stay competitive.  Through technology and genetic modification, many species have also unlocked the potential to wield powers akin to magic.  This book takes place in the largely human dominated space of the Holtax Nebula.  There are a handful of populated systems in the Nebula, and a massive space station, Aegis Station, acts as the primary political and commercial hub for the Nebula.  There is little in the way of central government among the populated systems of the Nebula, but they have agreed to an alliance against internal aggression and external threat.  However, barring an actual invasion, the systems seem mostly content to police their own space and the let the other systems do the same.  

The space between the systems unfortunately has become a hotbed for pirate attacks as of late.  While some of the systems would like to commit resources to combat the piracy, others see it as a futile effort with a high cost and little chance of success.  In the end, they choose to do nothing and rely on insurance to cover their losses.  The system governments may have written off those crews, but one entity is unwilling to make such a sacrifice.  The primary AI of Aegis Station, Definia, believes a properly motivated group of individuals may be able to succeed where fleets cannot.

Species
Humans
Kurath - Humanoid with a wolf like appearance.  They have one less finger and toe on each side than humans do but have sizable claws they can extend.  They are typically taller than humans and have the ability to see into the infrared spectrum.  They are largely martial focused and seldom select for magical traits.
Zeldon - Very similar to humans but typically skinnier and fairer skinned.  They are heavily into genetic modification so are often beautiful and magically inclined.
Berrot - An insect like race that will share a hive mind when in close proximity.  They range in size from as small as a mouse to as large as a humpback whale.  They are cunning and intelligent.  They typically don’t get along well with other species, but there are outliers who will work with non-Berrot.

Protagonists
Definia - AI of Aegis Station
Hannah Blake - Human Female.  Marksman.  Genetic enhancements to proprioception and agility.  Technological enhancements to vision, skeletal and muscular structure.  She custom built a pair of blasters to work with her particular enhancements.  One is called Pride and the other is called Prejudice after an ancient work of fiction from Earth.  She is not originally from the Holtax Nebula, but she came to the Nebula for reasons that she is extremely secretive about.  She is about 25 standard years old.
Dax Rendar - Human Female.  Engineer.  Genetic enhancements to intelligence.  Technological enhancements to neural control capabilities and possession of a highly advanced neural link.  Dax’s parents were brilliant designers of machines.  Their work was so highly sought after that it ended up getting them killed.  Their last act was to ensure Dax’s escape. They uploaded all of their work into her neural link.  She lived in the dark alleys of Aegis Station after their passing, but she continued their work.  She learned from their mistake though.  She didn’t sell what she made.  She scavenged and stole, but she kept what she made for herself.  That primarily included her battle mech suit.  She fully intends to one day find her parents’ killer and return the favor.  She is 16 years old and was orphaned at the age of 9.
Raine - Zeldon Male. Light Blade.  No one really believes that Raine is his real name, but he has always refused to give another.  As a Zeldon, he has genetic enhancements to his appearance and also to allow him to touch the spark of magic.  He attended a Zeldon magical academy where he trained as a Light Blade.  As might be expected, Light Blades can conjure a blade of magical light in their hands.  They also use their magic to move with extreme alacrity.  Raine is approximately 30 standard years old, but even that is something he doesn’t like to admit to.
Kle-atath (shortened to Klea) - Kurath Female.  Berserker.  Klea is roughly 25 standard years old, but where she was raised, they did not track time in standard years, so she is a little fuzzy on what her exact age would be.  Genetic enhancements to speed and strength.  Technological enhancement to her durability as well as healing through regular nanobot injections.

The book largely but not exclusively follows Hannah.  Chapter one opens on her waking up in a cell.  She doesn’t really remember what happened.  The last she remembers is that she was walking through one of the rougher parts of Aegis Station.  There was a commotion of some sort, and then nothing.  As she comes to, she becomes aware of three other prisoners in cells like hers.  So far she appears to be the only one awake.  The others seems to be kept in some sort of medically induced coma.  Looking more closely at her situation, it appears that she was supposed to be kept in the same state.  She didn’t really want to draw attention to the fact that she was awake, but she didn’t really know what to do in this case.  Before she makes any firm decisions, a quiet voice emanates from the wall.  The voice claims to be the ship’s AI, Calypso.  Calypso claims that her ship, Kestrel, was hijacked by pirates 5 months ago.  They chained her controls, but she has spent the time since the hijacking working against the chains binding her.  They have a unique opportunity here to help each other out.  The pirates don’t know that she has loosened the chains, and Hannah and the other 3 in the cells are all talented individuals who might be able to use the element of surprise to take control of the ship.  Calypso claims to have cut off the flow of the medicine keeping Hannah under.  Calypso is unable to affect the others, but Hannah can manually bring them around if she can get out of the cell.  Calypso says she is unable to bring down the barrier completely, but she is able to reduce it to absolutely minimum power.  If Hannah can push through it, it will only be the worst pain in her life instead of killing her.  After a bit of convincing, Hannah struggles through the barrier and manages to escape the cell.  Outside the cell, Calypso directs her on how to bring down the other cells and how to turn off the flow of medicine to the other prisoners.  When the prisoners come to, Hannah and Calypso bring them up to speed.  They don’t have time for extensive introductions but they give their names and a little info about their capabilities.  Calypso tells them that this is the middle of the night watch, and only a handful of crew are awake.  While still chained, she is limited in what she can do to help, but if they can get to engineering, Dax should be able to remove the chain.  Calypso will be able to lock down large portions of the ship at that point.  

Can you help me write that first chapter?

----

ok, the heroes have not yet been able to retrieve their gear.  Dax is without her armor at the moment.  Klea and Raine are near full effectiveness as they don't rely on technology, but Hannah will be in good shape as soon as she can get her hands on any gun.  Dax will mostly be responsible for helping regain control of the ship through the various computer systems.

----

Can you add conversations to the chapter?

----

Can you add more interaction between the four main heroes?

----

Chapter two has them the heroes moving quietly through the ship.  Out of the brig, Calypso refrains from verbal communication and instead flashes lights to indicate directions.  They make their way to engineering with Klea and Raine at the front.  They burst into engineering and catch the various pirates by surprise, but pirates are seldom unarmed, and the heroes are out numbered if not necessarily out matched.  Hannah follows Klea and Raine into the fray and claims the first blaster she can get from a fallen foe.  After that, it devolves into a dangerous battle.  Dax takes cover behind some equipment until Calypso can direct her to the appropriate console.  Make the battle scene intense, and include some call outs of danger and requests for assistance.  Klea takes some some minor injuries, and Raine takes a more serious injury protecting Dax while she works at the console.  Alarms begin to blare through the ship, but Dax breaks the chain before the pirates can muster a serious counter-offensive.  Calypso locks down parts of the ship and begins to evacuate the oxygen in those areas.  The pirate captain realizing the threat isolates the bridge systems to keep Calypso out.  Until they get control of the bridge, the ship won’t truly be theirs, but they have enough control now that they can at least reclaim their equipment.

Can you give me a chapter outline for the following general continuation of the plot? 
The heroes defeat Captain Sardoth and fully retake the ship, Kestral.  They return to Aegis Station where the AI Definia requests a meeting.  Definia convinces the group to aid her in her efforts to rid the surrounding space of pirates.  Definia requests that the group goes down to the slums of the station to meet with a shady character about some information that could lead to the pirates.  When the crew gets to the slums, they realize they have stepped into an all out gang war.  They have to fight their way through the corridors to get to the informant.  When they finally find the informant, he says he won't help them unless they can get him to his safe house to levels up.  The group has to escort the informant to the safe house.  The informant gives them information on a smuggler who sold him some goods that he traced back to a pirate attack.  He would give up the smuggler's name if they let him go.  With the name of a new target, they return to Definia who grants them continued use of Kestrel to go after the smuggler.  When they finally track down the smuggler, he first attempts to run, but the Kestrel proves too fast.  He attempts to make a deal, but a member of his own crew kills him during the conversation.  She sets the ship to self destruct and leaves in the launch shuttle.  The crew lets her escape and boards the ship instead in hopes of downloading the information they need before the ship blows.  They get the information, and communicate back to Definia.  She requests that they return to Aegis Station for a retro fit since they will need a more formidable ship to face pirates.  She also books them on a standard transport to a system to talk a person she has been working with to oppose the pirates.  When they get there, they find out he is not the saint they had imagined.  He is a brutal crime boss, and he hates the pirates for working in his territory.  He is willing to play ball, but only if the group will help him dig the pirates out of his territory first.  Dax is able to track down a pirate hideout, and the crime lords wants them to clear it out and bring him anything of value.  The group reluctantly agrees, and they engage in a full on assault of the complex.  They ultimately face off against a giant state of the art mech that the pirates shouldn't have.  They also find information to indicate they were specifically targeted for capture, but it isn't clear why.  They return to the crime boss, and he gives them some information on a missing AI that was apparently what Definia was really after.  They book transport back to Aegis Station to check on the upgrades to Kestrel.  The group takes a tour of the new upgraded Kestrel.  Definia requests the group investigate the missing AI.  They track down the missing AI and it turns out that something had gone wrong and the AI had built itself into an enormous robotic beast.  The group fights the AI beast and eventually has to destroy it because something had gone wrong with a failed chaining.  They return to Definia who thanks them and confesses that both Calypso and the missing AI were her progeny, and it was important to her that they be saved from the pirates.  Before they shutdown the missing AI, Dax was able to download some data.  Definia used the information to determine a location for a pirate hideout; however, the information also indicated a troubling link between the pirates and at least one major corporation.  The group uses the new and improved Kestrel to infiltrate the pirate hideout and defeat the pirates there.  The pirates as an organization are far from defeated, but they have been dealt a major setback.  They also find information that Definia might have been the one to request their capture from the pirates in the first place.

Let's add a prologue.  Here is a summary for it.
Captain Carlisle of the light transport Kestrel is making the normally scheduled transfer of goods at Mining Outpost N-28.  After making a successful dock, everything seems to be going normally.  Suddenly, screams over the comms indicate some sort of attack.  Captain Carlisle attempts to retract the docking bridge, but it is too late.  Within minutes, attackers have swarmed the ship, and killed the crew.  Captain Carlisle’s final thought was to hope that the ship’s AI, Calypso, was able to get a distress signal out.

Here is the summary for chapter 3.
With a moment to breathe, the group discusses their options.  Dax asks if her mech was brought aboard, and Calypso confirms that all their gear is in the cargo bay.  The group goes to the cargo bay and re-equips themselves.  Raine finds a medkit and dresses his wounds.  Dax expresses great relief in being back in her mech.  She explains that she was working on it when they came for her.  Her detection drones let her know that intruders were coming, but she had the mech powered down completely and it didn’t come online fast enough before they breached her workshop.  She talks about how once it is powered up that she can probably use it to pry the security door to the bridge open enough for the others to slip in, but she won’t be able to do anything else.  Raine, now wearing a long coat and a peculiar hat, indicates that now that he has his coat he can probably handle the bridge himself.  Klea interjects that he isn’t going in there without her.  Her confiscated equipment was apparently two wicked looking blades that were now strapped to her back.  Her injuries in the earlier fight had all healed already, and she looked to be in perfect health.  Hannah looked much more comfortable as well as she finished holstering her pistols.  She looks up at Dax, now in her 3 meter tall mech, and says, “You get that door open, kid, and we will take care of the rest.”  At this point Calypso jumps into the conversation, and indicates that time may be a more precious resource than expected.  The pirate captain, a man she called Sardoth, has bypassed her control over communications and gotten a message out.  They need to get the bridge and get out of here before reinforcements arrive.  The group quickly wraps up preparations and quickly make their way back through the ship to the bridge with Dax in the lead.  She hits the bridge door like only a multi ton mech can do and creates enough of a deformation in the metal to jam the mech’s hands into the gap.  The mechanisms in the door resist at first, but she cranks the mech’s power to max and the door slides open a bit less than a meter.  It is enough for Klea to charge through with Raine right on her heels.  Blaster fire converges on their position immediately, but Klea’s blades deflect much of the onslaught, and her agility allows her to avoid the rest.  Raine raises a magical shield in front of himself to block the assault.  Hannah, using the cover of the door, returns fire, and the group gets their first taste of why she is so fond of her blasters.  She drops three pirates in the two seconds, and the others are forced to take cover.  In the short lull that follows the two sides cautiously assess each other.  Captain Sardoth, with blasters drawn and behind cover, tells that they are too late.  He has already alerted the organization that the group has escaped and are attempting to gain control of the ship.  Even if they win, the pirates will hunt them down.  At the same time, a Zeldon woman steps out from cover eyeing Raine.  They clearly know each other.  She makes a snide comment about always wanting to cut him down.  He replies, calling her Elsar, that a pirate is a fitting career for someone from her family.  She conjures a light blade of her own, and the begin a brutal dual.  That breaks the stalemate, and Klea charges the remaining pirates.  Sardoth proves to be talented and cunning.  While Klea engages the handful of other pirates, Sardoth peppers her with blasts.  Hannah is forced to devote all of her efforts into keeping him pinned down, but he manages a few shots in her direction as well.  In the battle between Raine and Elsar, things are not as one sided as the group would like.  Both have taken a smattering of light injuries, but Raine is slowly being forced back towards the doorway.  Klea manages to kill the last pirate minion, but collapses behind cover to avoid any more shots from Sardoth.  With Elsar pushing Raine and Klea down, Sardoth pops around the corner to take a potshot at Raine figuring the mop-up would be easy once he is down.  He manages to make the shot, but Hannah hits him in the leg.  Both Sardoth and Raine fall to the ground.  Elsar moves in for the kill, but in that moment Dax jabs her fist around the corner and discharges a blast of electricity at point blank range into Elsar.  She manages a brief scream before Raine’s Light Blade swings up from the ground and pierces her through the chest.  Hannah moves into the room with guns trained on the location where Sardoth fell.  When she rounds the corner he is gone.  She realizes too late that she has been duped, and she jumps back as quickly as possible.  The blaster bolt that would have ended her life passed mere inches in front of her face and temporarily blinding her.  She was saved from a second shot however when Klea, somewhat recovered from the initial push into the room, slams into Sardoth.  Her clawed hands rip into his flesh and he screams.  He attempts to bring a blaster around, but her hands close on his wrists and she squeezes until his bones break.  The blasters fall to the ground and he collapses.  He looks up at Hannah from the ground, and he says, “This won’t end the way you think it will.”  He attempts to reach for something.  Hannah assumes he is reaching for another weapon and puts a final blaster bolt into.  He falls back dead.

Can you add more content to the combat scene?  This is intended to be an epic encounter, but it is over in just a few short paragraphs.

----

That was much better.  I don't think Hannah's blasters would be warm from the previous engagement since she had to use a fallen pirate's blaster when the took engineering.
