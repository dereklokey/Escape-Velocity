"Docking complete, Captain," the ship's AI, Calypso, announced, her melodious voice echoing through the command deck of the Kestrel, a light transport ship. Captain Carlisle nodded, his eyes scanning the plethora of holographic displays projecting from the command console.

"Commence offloading, Calypso," he ordered, his fingers tapping away on the translucent keys, confirming the transfer of goods to Mining Outpost N-28.

As the ship's mechanical systems hummed to life, a routine operation unfolded with clockwork precision. The cargo bay doors whirred open, automated droids scurrying to load containers onto the transfer bridge connecting the Kestrel to the outpost.

It was as uneventful a day as any in the cold vastness of space, the kind Captain Carlisle had come to appreciate. But tranquility was a fickle companion in the cosmos.

The first indication of trouble was a sudden shrill alarm from the comms system. Then, an agonized scream ripped through the static, sending a chill down Carlisle's spine. Calypso's voice cut through the commotion, a note of urgency coloring her usually calm tone.

"Captain, multiple life signs detected on the docking bridge."

Carlisle was already on his feet, rushing towards the security console. "Retract the bridge, Calypso. Now!"

But it was too late. Through the surveillance feed, he could see figures clad in dark, menacing suits pouring onto his ship. There was no mistaking them - pirates.

They moved with ruthless efficiency, cutting down the crew as they advanced. Each blip of life on the monitor flickered and disappeared, replaced by a cold dread that crept into Carlisle’s heart.

In the face of overwhelming odds, he made one last desperate attempt. "Calypso, send a distress signal! Get help!"

But even as he uttered the command, the door to the command deck exploded inward, and the pirates flooded the room. Through his rising fear, Captain Carlisle clung to one last hope: that Calypso, the AI he had come to view as a friend and ally, had heard his command. That help was on its way.

As the first blaster bolt seared through the air towards him, Captain Carlisle’s final thought was a simple plea. "Survive, Calypso."

Then, everything went black.
