# Escape-Velocity
This repo is for the work of creating a ChatGPT written novel.

The repo will be broken down into a small number of areas. At the top will be the setting and character files. Those are used as initial prompts into ChatGPT to establish a baseline for the writing.  If a ChatGPT session maxes out, the hope is that starting a new session and prompting with the same baseline information will allow work to continue mostly unimpeded.  There will be a folder for prompts and they will typically be broken up by chapter.  This is to establish the lineage of how the book was written.  There will be a folder of the actual chapters.  Hopefully the commit history will allow for seeing the evolution of the work as I get better at prompting ChatGPT.

Finally, I am putting this in a public repo because I am open to contributions from others who are interested in experimenting with ChatGPT in this way.
