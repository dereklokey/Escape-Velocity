# Escape-Velocity
This repo is for the work of creating a ChatGPT written novel.

The repo will be broken down into a small number of areas. At the top will be the setting and character files. Those are used as initial prompts into ChatGPT to establish a baseline for the writing.  If a ChatGPT session maxes out, the hope is that starting a new session and prompting with the same baseline information will allow work to continue mostly unimpeded.  There will be a folder for prompts and they will typically be broken up by chapter.  This is to establish the lineage of how the book was written.  There will be a folder of the actual chapters.  Hopefully the commit history will allow for seeing the evolution of the work as I get better at prompting ChatGPT.

So originally (v1) I attempted to build a lot of setting and character info and provide pretty detailed chapter summaries as prompts for ChatGPT.  I was a little disappointed with the output from ChatGPT.  It was often just restating what I wrote without really adding to it.  With a little more playing, I have found that I get much better responses if my prompts are much more open.  I am not sure how guiding the story will work with v2, but I am hopeful for a better outcome.
