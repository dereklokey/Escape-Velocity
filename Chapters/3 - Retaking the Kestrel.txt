Chapter 3: Retaking the Kestrel

The crew stood in the now quiet cargo bay, the cold steel beneath their boots carrying a sense of familiarity. Dax, surrounded by the metallic exoskeleton of her mech, was the picture of relief. She flexed the mech’s fingers, feeling the power flow through the servos as if it were her own strength.

"I was halfway through repairs when they attacked," she confessed, her voice echoing from within the cockpit. "They were on top of us before I could even power up the defense systems."

Raine, now draped in a long coat and wearing a peculiar hat, watched her fondly from across the bay. "With my coat and Dax's mech," he mused, "we can probably handle anything the pirates throw at us."

“Not without me, you’re not,” Klea interjected, eyeing her twin blades strapped securely to her back. “And don’t even think about leaving Hannah behind,” she added as the weapons expert holstered her pistols, a smug smile playing on her lips.

Just then, Calypso’s voice filled the air, “Captain Sardoth has bypassed my controls. He's sent a message out. We need to retake the bridge before reinforcements arrive.”

With renewed urgency, the crew equipped themselves, preparing for the assault on the bridge. Raine, with an air of quiet confidence, took the lead, followed closely by Klea, then Hannah, with Dax bringing up the rear in her mech.

The heavy metal doors to the bridge didn't stand a chance against Dax’s mech. With a loud crash and the screech of metal, she forced them open enough for Klea and Raine to squeeze through.

The moment Dax's mech created the gap in the security door, Klea was through it, a blur of motion as her dual blades leapt to her hands. Blaster bolts flew through the air, their bright trails painting lines of danger across the room. But Klea was too fast, too nimble. She twisted and spun through the barrage, her blades a whirlwind of reflecting light. The first pirate fell with a gasp, a deep slash across his chest spelling his doom.

Raine was right behind her, his long coat flaring out behind him like the wings of a predatory bird. His hands were a flurry of movement as he conjured his magic shield, a shimmering barrier of mystical energy. It deflected blaster bolts with ease, the energy dispersing harmlessly across its surface.

Hannah, from behind the relative safety of the door, retaliated with blaster fire of her own, dropping three pirates in quick succession.

Their ambush disrupted, the pirates took cover, and a brief silence fell over the room. Captain Sardoth spoke from behind a console, his eyes burning with defiance. “You're too late,” he snarled, “The message has been sent. Even if you win here, our allies will hunt you down.”

Amid the tense standoff, a Zeldon woman stepped out from behind the pirates' barricade, eyeing Raine with a cold smirk. “Always wanted to cut you down, Raine,” she taunted, conjuring a light blade.

In the brutal duel that followed, Raine was slowly pushed back toward the doorway, his shield barely holding against the Zeldon woman's relentless assault. Meanwhile, Hannah and Klea managed to take down the remaining pirates, but not before Klea took several hits.

With Klea down and Raine pinned, Sardoth saw his chance. He took aim at Raine, only to be hit in the leg by Hannah. Both men went down, Sardoth disappearing from sight behind a console.

The Zeldon woman, seeing Raine fall, moved to finish him off. But before her blade could connect, Dax's mech arm swung around the corner, blasting her point-blank with a stream of electricity. In her surprise, she didn't see Raine’s light blade until it had already pierced her chest.

Just as Hannah moved into the room, blasters trained on Sardoth's last known location, she felt a sense of unease. Ducking back just in time, a blaster bolt whizzed past her, missing by mere inches. She didn't have to guess who fired the shot.

Klea, however, was quick to respond. With a speed that belied her injuries, she launched herself at Sardoth, claws ripping into his flesh. The pirate captain screamed in agony as she crushed his wrists, dropping his blasters.

“This won’t end the way you think it will,” he spat out, reaching for something hidden. 

Not taking any chances, Hannah shot him dead. As Sardoth’s lifeless body fell back, the crew could only wonder what his cryptic warning meant. For now, though, the Kestrel was theirs once more.
