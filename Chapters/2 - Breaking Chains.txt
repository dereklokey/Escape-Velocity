Chapter 2 - Breaking Chains

The corridors of the Kestrel were dimly lit and eerily quiet as the newly-formed team moved silently through the maze of steel. Gone were the verbal directions from Calypso; instead, unobtrusive flashes of light guided their path to engineering. 

Klea, with her heightened senses, took the lead, with Raine following closely behind. Hannah, her hand itching for the feel of her custom blasters, was right on their heels. Dax brought up the rear, her sharp gaze scanning their surroundings. 

They rounded the final corner, and engineering sprawled out before them. Several pirates turned in surprise as they burst into the room, but surprise quickly turned to action. The room erupted into chaos, with pirates reaching for their weapons, yelling out warnings. 

Hannah followed Klea and Raine into the fray. She spotted a fallen pirate, his blaster skittering across the floor. Hannah darted forward, scooping it up and bringing it to bear. She fired, taking out a pirate who had been charging at Raine. 

"Raine, behind you!" Hannah shouted, her warning barely cutting through the noise. Raine deflected a brutal blow, his light blade flaring as he turned to face his attacker.

Dax ducked behind a piece of equipment, her fingers flying over the neural link's interface as Calypso guided her to the console controlling the shipâ€™s chains. 

Meanwhile, the battle raged on. Klea fought with a primal ferocity, shrugging off hits that would have felled a lesser being. But even her formidable resilience was tested, and she grunted in pain as a blade found its mark.

"Dax, we need those chains off now!" Raine called, a note of urgency in his voice. His light blade moved in a blur, keeping two pirates at bay as he defended Dax's position.

"Working on it!" Dax shot back, her concentration undeterred by the battle raging around her.

Suddenly, alarms began to sound throughout the ship. Hannah's heart pounded in her chest as she continued to exchange fire with the pirates. They were running out of time.

With a triumphant yell, Dax finally broke through the chains. "Done!"

The ship shuddered as Calypso took control, sealing off sections and initiating an oxygen purge. But their victory was incomplete. The captain's voice echoed over the intercom, full of rage and desperation. He'd isolated the bridge, keeping Calypso at bay. 

"We need to take the bridge," Hannah said, meeting the gazes of her allies. They were bloodied and bruised, but their eyes held the same steely resolve. They had taken engineering. They could take the bridge too.

"First things first," Raine said, grimacing as he clutched a wound on his side. "We need our gear."

Hannah nodded, her grip tightening on her pilfered blaster. They had a fighting chance now. They were not prisoners anymore; they were a rebellion, a force to be reckoned with. 

And they were just getting started.
