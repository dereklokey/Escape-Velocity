**Captain Taryn "Ghost" Moray**: Taryn Moray, known by her comrades as "Ghost," is an ex-military officer who served in the Elite Starforce Rangers, a division known for their prowess in combat and expertise in advanced warfare.

Despite her aim to live a life of anonymity after leaving the military, Taryn is an expert marksman, her skills honed over many years and battlefields. She's tried to leave her past behind, intending to live a quiet life on a small colony on the outskirts of the Milgrom System. But her keen senses, acute tactical mind, and inherent sense of justice don't fade as easily.

She is a reluctant hero, who, despite her desire for peace, can't ignore the wrongs that continue to plague the galaxy. Injustice, in any form, stirs her from her desired quietude. She carries the weight of her past, haunted by her memories, yet it is these experiences that drive her, shape her actions, and inevitably pull her into conflicts she'd prefer to avoid. Taryn's military past and unyielding moral compass make her a compelling and complex character in this advanced, diverse universe.
