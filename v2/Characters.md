* Describe a character who is haunted by her past in the military, but she is a skilled marksman and is incapable of turning a blind eye toward injustice even when she wants to.

**Captain Taryn "Ghost" Moray**: Taryn Moray, known by her comrades as "Ghost," is an ex-military officer who served in the Elite Starforce Rangers, a division known for their prowess in combat and expertise in advanced warfare. Her nickname comes from her uncanny ability to operate unnoticed and her precise, surgical strike capabilities that made her seem to appear and disappear on the battlefield like a phantom.

Standing at an average height, Taryn's physique is lean and hard from years of military training. Her sharp aquiline features and striking grey eyes reflect a life of relentless discipline and formidable challenges.

Her past in the military is a memory filled with shades of both glory and despair. She has seen the best and worst of humanity among the stars and carries the physical and emotional scars of those encounters. Her right arm, replaced with a high-tech prosthetic after a devastating battle, serves as a constant reminder of her past.

Despite her aim to live a life of anonymity after leaving the military, Taryn is an expert marksman, her skills honed over many years and battlefields. She's tried to leave her past behind, intending to live a quiet life on a small colony on the outskirts of the Milgrom System. But her keen senses, acute tactical mind, and inherent sense of justice don't fade as easily.

She is a reluctant hero, who, despite her desire for peace, can't ignore the wrongs that continue to plague the galaxy. Injustice, in any form, stirs her from her desired quietude. She carries the weight of her past, haunted by her memories, yet it is these experiences that drive her, shape her actions, and inevitably pull her into conflicts she'd prefer to avoid. Taryn's military past and unyielding moral compass make her a compelling and complex character in this advanced, diverse universe.

* Describe a character who is roughly 18 who has been on her own for a long time and is an engineering wiz.  She has designed her own mech suit.

**Selene Mercer**: At just 18 years old, Selene Mercer is a prodigious young engineer who has been on her own for a significant part of her life. Born into challenging circumstances, she quickly learned to rely on her intellect and resourcefulness to navigate the world around her.
