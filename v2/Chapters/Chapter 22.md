Eliza stood in her dimly lit hideout, her face contorted in a mix of fury and frustration. Her piercing scream echoed through the room, filling the air with an unsettling energy. The sound of shattering glass and crashing objects accompanied her outburst as she lashed out, venting her rage in a fit of uncontrollable anger.

Her manic eyes darted around the room, searching for something to release her pent-up frustration upon. In a fit of madness, she seized a nearby glass vase, hurling it across the space with all her might. It shattered against the wall, shards of glass scattering in all directions, mirroring the fragmented state of Eliza's mind.

Her clenched fists trembled with fury as she stomped across the room, overturning furniture and sending objects flying in a chaotic frenzy. The room bore the marks of her violent outburst, a testament to her unstable nature and unpredictable temperament.

Eliza's distorted laughter filled the room, mingling with her screams of rage. Her laughter was devoid of any semblance of sanity, a chilling sound that sent shivers down the spine of anyone unfortunate enough to witness it.

As she continued her destructive tirade, a seething anger burned within her. The failure to eliminate Dr. Barnes, Captain Moray, and Subject 741 before the explosives took effect gnawed at her twisted soul. The uncontrollable rage that had consumed her mind was now unleashed upon her surroundings, a reflection of her distorted psyche.

With every broken object, every shattered piece of glass, Eliza's rage grew more palpable. She reveled in the chaos, finding solace in the destruction that surrounded her. It was a manifestation of her inner turmoil, a visual representation of the darkness that consumed her.

Amidst the wreckage, Eliza's voice resounded, filled with a chilling determination. She vowed to find them, to make them pay for their interference, and to fulfill her twisted desires. The broken pieces of her hideout were a metaphor for the shattered remnants of her sanity, a reflection of the darkness that had consumed her soul.

In her distorted mind, she relished the chaos and destruction, finding perverse pleasure in the display of her unhinged emotions. The broken objects and shattered fragments were mere casualties of her descent into madness, evidence of her relentless pursuit of power and control.

As the echoes of her screams and the crashing of objects slowly subsided, Eliza was left standing amidst the wreckage, a figure consumed by her own madness. Her distorted laughter mingled with the eerie silence that followed, a haunting reminder of the depths of her psychopathy.

In that moment, Eliza Donovan reveled in her madness, embracing the darkness that enveloped her. She would stop at nothing to achieve her twisted goals, no matter the cost or the wreckage left in her wake. The shattered remains of her hideout were a testament to the chaos she unleashed, a prelude to the darkness yet to come.

A faint glow illuminated the room as a notification appeared on the one unbroken monitor. The screen flickered to life, displaying a blinking icon indicating an incoming video call. Eliza's eyes darted towards the monitor, her expression a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. With a deep breath, she reluctantly accepted the call, steeling herself for what awaited on the other end.

The video call connected, revealing Richard Blackwood's stern face on the screen. His eyes narrowed with anger as he stared at Eliza, his voice laced with a seething fury.

"What the hell just happened, Eliza? Why did Dr. Barnes' apartment explode?" he demanded, his tone dripping with rage.

Eliza's manic laughter echoed through the room, her voice filled with a deranged satisfaction. "They got him, Richard! I told you they would get him if you didn't let me eliminate him. And now they have him!" she screamed, her voice filled with madness.

Richard's features twisted with a combination of shock and realization. He began to comprehend the true depths of the situation, understanding the consequences of Eliza's words. His anger shifted into a mixture of concern and apprehension as he processed what she said.

"How did this happen, Eliza?" Richard's voice trembled slightly, a hint of fear creeping into his words. "You were supposed to take care of this, not make it worse."

Eliza's laughter continued, her distorted expression a twisted mask of delight. "You made me wait, Richard. You made me wait, and now they have him. Dr. Barnes just saw us try to eliminate him, and now he will tell them everything Darkstone has done," she shrieked, her voice resonating with a chilling intensity.

Richard's face paled, his eyes widening in realization. He now understood the gravity of Eliza's actions and the dangerous game she had been playing. The situation had spiraled out of control, and they were all standing on the precipice of a catastrophe.

The furious exchange continued, with Eliza's screams intertwining with Richard's desperate attempts to reason with her. The conversation grew more heated as they argued about the consequences of their actions and the uncertain future that lay ahead.

Amidst the chaos, Richard's voice finally broke through, his tone laced with a mix of concern and resolve. "Eliza, we need to regroup and assess the situation. We can't afford any more mistakes. The repercussions could be catastrophic."

Eliza's eyes blazed with a dangerous intensity as she stared into the screen, her voice dripping with venom. "You should have listened to me, Richard. I warned you. Now we'll see who's in control," she hissed, her words a chilling prophecy of the chaos that was yet to come.

Eliza abruptly terminated the video call, her face contorted with frustration and anger. She paced back and forth in her hideout, muttering to herself as she formulated a new plan. Her mind raced, seeking alternatives and possibilities amidst the chaos of her thoughts. With a determined gleam in her eyes, she began to map out a different course of action, weaving a web of deception and manipulation. The pieces were falling into place, and a wicked grin crept across her lips as she contemplated the potential outcomes. Eliza Donovan was not one to be easily defeated, and she would find a way to turn the tides back in her favor.

She stood in the center of her dimly lit hideout, her mind racing with thoughts and plans. The glow of the monitors cast an eerie light on her face as she paced back and forth, the room filled with the sound of her murmurs.

"They think they've gained an advantage by capturing Barnes," Eliza muttered, her voice tinged with a mix of frustration and determination. "He may hold valuable information, but he's just one piece of the puzzle. To truly strike a blow against Darkstone, they'll have to go straight to the heart of the beast."

She paused, her eyes narrowing as a wicked smile crept across her face. "And when they do, I'll be there waiting for them," she hissed, relishing the thought of the confrontation that lay ahead. "They may think they're clever, but they have no idea what they're up against."

Eliza's hands clenched into fists as she continued her monologue, her voice growing more animated. "I'll be prepared. I'll have every trick up my sleeve, ready to exploit their weaknesses and turn their own plans against them. They won't see it coming until it's too late."

Her eyes gleamed with a mix of anticipation and malice as she visualized the imminent clash between them. "They may be resourceful, but they underestimate me. They think they hold all the cards, but little do they know, I've been playing this game for a long time."

With a surge of confidence, Eliza let out a low, sinister laugh. "They won't know what hit them. I'll dismantle their every move, crush their hopes, and emerge victorious. They may have Barnes, but I hold the key to their downfall."

Eliza's thoughts turned to Richard, her frustration and anger towards him simmering beneath the surface. She paced back and forth, her steps quick and determined, as she contemplated her next move.

"It's his fault," she muttered under her breath, her voice laced with venom. "Richard's incompetence and hesitation have put everything at risk. He doesn't have the vision, the cunning, or the ruthlessness to lead Darkstone through this. It's time I take matters into my own hands."

A sinister smile crept across her face as she toyed with the idea of eliminating Richard. "He's become a liability, a hindrance to our cause. With him out of the picture, I can assume control and steer Darkstone towards true power and dominance."

Eliza's eyes narrowed as her mind raced, concocting schemes and strategies. "I've always been the one with the intellect, the strength, and the ambition to lead. It's time for me to rise, to seize what is rightfully mine."

She strode towards the holographic screens, her fingers dancing across the controls with calculated precision. "He won't see it coming until it's too late."

Eliza's voice grew colder and more resolute. "Darkstone needs a leader who is willing to make the hard choices, who won't back down in the face of adversity. I am that leader. I have the cunning, the ruthlessness, and the determination to guide Darkstone to ultimate victory."

A fire burned in her eyes as she finalized her plans, her gaze fixed on the holographic display. "Richard may have been the figurehead, but the real power lies with me. And I won't rest until I've taken what is rightfully mine."

With a sly smile, Eliza plotted her next move, ready to manipulate and maneuver her way to the top, leaving Richard and anyone who dared stand in her way in the dust.
