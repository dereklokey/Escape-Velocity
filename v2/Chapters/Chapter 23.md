The hum of the engines filled the cabin as Shadowhawk soared through the night sky, carrying the team and their valuable captive, Dr. Victor Barnes. Taryn, Selene, Maya, and Adrian exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of relief and determination.

As the ship descended towards the safe house, Taryn's voice broke the silence. "Alright, everyone, prepare for landing. We're almost there."

Adrian's hands deftly maneuvered the controls, guiding Shadowhawk smoothly towards their destination. The ship touched down softly, its landing gear absorbing the impact. The team unstrapped themselves from their seats, ready to carry out the next phase of their mission.

They moved with purpose as they entered the safe house, Taryn leading the way with Dr. Barnes in tow. The holding cell they had meticulously prepared awaited them, its steel bars a stark reminder of the importance of their captive.

Dr. Barnes's voice rang out from behind the bars, a mix of curiosity and frustration evident in his tone. "Why have you brought me here? And why did you blow up my apartment?"

Taryn stepped closer to the cell, her gaze steady as she met his eyes. "We've captured you because we need answers, Dr. Barnes. Darkstone's experiments and their plans for domination cannot go unchecked. We won't let them continue their dangerous work."

A wry smile played on Dr. Barnes's lips. "And what makes you think I'll cooperate? You're just a team of rebels, trying to play heroes. You have no idea what Darkstone is truly capable of."

Selene's voice cut through the air, filled with determination. "We may not have the resources of a massive corporation, but we have something they lackâ€”morals and the will to fight for what's right. We're here to ensure that your knowledge is used to dismantle Darkstone, not to perpetuate their atrocities."

Maya's eyes locked onto Dr. Barnes, her voice filled with intensity. "You may think you're untouchable, but when we drag you in front of the Interstellar Assembly, they might find my testimony very interesting. You will answer for your actions. The only thing that will help you now is helping us."

Dr. Barnes's expression shifted, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. "And what guarantee do I have that turning against Darkstone will ensure my safety?"

Taryn's eyes narrowed, her voice firm. "We're not in the business of revenge, Dr. Barnes. We seek justice. If you cooperate and provide us with the information we need, we'll ensure that you receive a fair trial, and your actions will be exposed. But make no mistake, if you choose not to help us, you're going to take the fall for all of it. By the way, Dr. Barnes, we didn't blow up your apartment. Darkstone did. They saw you as a liability, someone who could expose their operations. They wanted to eliminate you to cover their tracks. When we got to your door. Maya smelled the explosives in your apartment, and we worked quickly to save your life."

Dr. Barnes's eyes widened in disbelief, a mixture of shock and realization crossing his face. "They... they tried to kill me? But why? I thought I was valuable to them."

Maya's voice joined the conversation, her tone stern. "You were valuable to them as long as you served their purpose. But now that you're in our custody, you're a threat. They wanted to remove any evidence that could lead back to them."

Taryn nodded, her voice unwavering. "Dr. Barnes, you need to understand that Darkstone will stop at nothing to protect their secrets. They're willing to sacrifice anyone who stands in their way, even their own employees. That's why it's crucial for us to stop them and bring their operations to light."

Dr. Barnes's expression shifted, a mix of fear and determination replacing his initial disbelief. "So, what's the plan? How are you going to stop them?"

Taryn's gaze hardened, her voice filled with resolve. "We're gathering information, infiltrating their facilities, and exposing their experiments to the world. You have valuable knowledge that can help us unravel their operations and bring them to justice. Together, we can expose the truth and ensure that Darkstone pays for their crimes."

Dr. Barnes's eyes flickered with a newfound sense of purpose. "You may not be in the business of revenge, but I certainly am. I'll help you for my own reasons. I don't care about your 'cause'."

Taryn's expression hardened, realizing the dangerous game they were now playing. "Fine, Dr. Barnes. You have our attention. Tell us everything. What is the state of their experiments? How far have they progressed?"

Dr. Barnes leaned back, his tone laced with a mix of arrogance and pride. "I had made significant progress. I managed to replicate the genetic modification that allowed for the transformation. Currently, there are twelve subjects undergoing the process, each one a potential weapon in Darkstone's hands, and each one is a volunteer on Darkstone's payroll."

Taryn clenched her fists, her determination burning brighter than ever. "We need to stop them. We need to know the location of their black site, the facility where they conduct these experiments."

Dr. Barnes chuckled, relishing in the power he now held. "Oh, I can give you the location, Captain. But remember, this is a dangerous game. Darkstone won't let you just walk in and take what you want. They'll be prepared. And I have my own score to settle."

Taryn's eyes narrowed, her resolve unwavering. "We know the risks, Dr. Barnes. But if you're truly willing to help us dismantle Darkstone, we'll take them head-on."

Dr. Barnes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with a mix of arrogance and triumph. "You want to know how badly Darkstone messed up? They didn't account for the fact that I had my own failsafe. A little insurance, if you will, in case they ever double-crossed me."

Taryn's curiosity piqued. "What kind of failsafe are you talking about?"

A smug grin spread across Dr. Barnes' face. "I embedded a hidden protocol within the genetic modifications they used to create the subjects. With the right access, I can activate it and neutralize all the active Subjects. Imagine that, Captain Moray, their precious army turned into nothing more than dormant test subjects."

Maya's eyes widened with a mix of surprise and intrigue. "You mean to tell us that you have the means to shut down their experiments? To render their subjects harmless?"

Dr. Barnes nodded, relishing in their astonishment. "Indeed. Darkstone may think they hold all the cards, but they never saw this coming. I always knew their was a chance I might need to take extraordinary measures, and I made sure to protect myself."

Taryn's mind raced with the possibilities. The information Dr. Barnes possessed could be their key to dismantling Darkstone's operations. "If we can get inside their facility, can you guide us to access the necessary systems to activate this failsafe?"

Dr. Barnes smirked, a glimmer of vindication in his eyes. "Oh, I can do more than guide you. I can be the one to activate it myself. After all, no one knows their systems better than the one who designed them."

The team exchanged glances, realizing the significance of Dr. Barnes' revelation. With his help, they had a chance to turn the tables on Darkstone, to disrupt their plans and bring an end to their twisted experiments.

Maya listened intently, her eyes narrowing as she processed the information. "What happens to the subjects when the failsafe is activated? Will it harm them?"

Dr. Barnes shook his head, a hint of satisfaction in his voice. "No, it won't harm them. In fact, the failsafe is designed to remove the genetic modification from their systems entirely. When activated, the subjects will fall into a deep, unconscious state while the modification gradually reverts and dissolves. It's a natural process that takes about a day."

Taryn furrowed her brow, contemplating the implications. "So, they won't be permanently altered? They'll eventually return to their normal state?"

Dr. Barnes nodded, a flicker of remorse crossing his face. "Yes, Captain Moray. The modification will be completely eradicated from their genetic makeup. They will regain their original forms, without any traces of the experiment."

Maya's voice trembled slightly as she posed her question. "And what about me? Can the failsafe be applied to me? Can I have my old life back?"

Dr. Barnes let out a chuckle, a cold smile tugging at the corners of his lips. "Oh, Maya, you truly don't understand, do you? The failsafe is not meant for you. It's a gift reserved for those who were meant to live, to serve Darkstone's grand vision. But for you, my dear, there is no going back to your old life."

Maya's heart sank, her eyes narrowing with a mix of anger and despair. "So you're saying I'm stuck like this? You find pleasure in my suffering?"

Dr. Barnes let out a scoff, his tone dripping with derision. "Oh, Maya, how you underestimate your own potential. You're wallowing in self-pity when you should be embracing the remarkable transformation you have undergone. You are one of the most advanced humans to have ever lived, a pinnacle of scientific achievement. Your mere existence is a testament to the possibilities of human evolution."

Maya's brows furrowed in frustration, her voice tinged with desperation. "But this isn't what I wanted. I didn't ask for any of this. I just want my old life back, my humanity."

Dr. Barnes leaned in, a malicious glint in his eyes. "Humanity? That quaint notion is a relic of the past, Maya. You have been elevated beyond the limitations of ordinary humans. You possess abilities and potential that far surpass their understanding. Why would you want to return to a mundane existence when you can be so much more?"

Taryn's jaw clenched, her voice laced with frustration. "You're sick, Barnes."

Maya's voice trembled with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. "And what about the others? Do they look like me?"

Dr. Barnes smirked, relishing in the revelation. "Oh no, Maya. The new ones, the latest batch of test subjects, they have taken on a different form. A sort of tiger hybrid, if you will. They possess the strength and agility of a tiger, combined with the enhanced abilities we bestowed upon them. They are faster and stronger than even you, Maya. Each one of them is worth a hundred normal men."

Maya's eyes widened, a mix of astonishment and concern flickering across her face. The thought of facing such formidable adversaries sent a shiver down her spine. She glanced at Taryn and the rest of the team, realizing the immense challenge they were up against.

Taryn's voice cut through the tension, her determination unwavering. "No matter how strong they are, we'll find a way to stop them, to put an end to this madness."

Dr. Barnes's voice dripped with a mix of arrogance and urgency. "You better hurry, Captain Moray. Darkstone's grip tightens with each passing day. There are already twelve subjects in the late phase of the trial, on the verge of becoming unstoppable forces. But that's not all. Today alone, we dosed hundreds more, injecting them with the transformative serum. By this time next week, Darkstone's army will be beyond your comprehension. They will be unstoppable."

A flicker of realization crossed Dr. Barnes's face as he remembered one crucial detail. "Ah, yes. I almost forgot to mention. The subjects we dosed earlier today, they were carefully selected from the gangs that Darkstone had been dealing with. It won't be long before chaos erupts in the streets. The gangs, now infused with the strength and ferocity of tigers, will clash in a battle for dominance, tearing the city apart. Darkstone's plan to destabilize society and create a power vacuum is already set in motion."

Taryn turned away from Dr. Barnes, her voice firm as she addressed the rest of the team. "Alright, let's give Dr. Barnes some time to contemplate his choices. We have a lot to discuss and plan."
