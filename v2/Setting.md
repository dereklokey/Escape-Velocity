The setting is far into the future. Humanity has reached the stars. Living in different systems and various worlds, space stations, asteroids, and many other locales along with technological advancements in areas like nano-techonology and genetics have created a wide divergence among humans to the point that humanity can no longer be called a single species. Humans are as varied as the imagination with some having the neurological affinities necessary of wielding technology so advanced it looks like magic but is simply called "Tech".  Sub-dimensional communication allows for near instaneous communication, but the Sub-dimensional spaces are only stable over a limited range and begins to fall off beyond 10 light years or so.  Ships are able to travel faster than light using a gravity warping technology.
