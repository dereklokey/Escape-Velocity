Can you make chapter 4 between 1800 and 2200 words based on the following?

After the pirates are defeated, the Hannah asks Calypso to get the ship moving while the group discusses what to do next.  They argue for a while about where to go.  Hannah doesn't want to draw too much attention, but Dax is insistent that they return to Aegis Station because that is where her workshop is.  Raine and Klea just want to get ahead of any pirates who may take an interest in them after Sardoth's message.  Calypso interjects and says that the station Aegis Station AI may be able to provide assistance.  Reluctantly, Hannah agrees to go Aegis Station.  Once the ship is underway, the group has the unsatisfying task of cleaning up the deceased pirates.  They decide not to space them since law enforcment may find some use for them, so they move the bodies to one of the smaller cargo bays.  Dax begins to come out of her shell, and starts asking more about the others.  Hannah answers politely that she was trained as a marksman in a system far from the Nebula, but when pushed she reveals little else.  Raine says that he was raised mostly on Martus at one of the magical academies.  That was where he trained to be a Light Blade.  When Dax pressed him on his name, he refused to offer anything more.  Klea tells the group that she was raised on Kalatic, and that she was a pit fighter there for many years.  Hannah is unfamiliar with the planet, so Klea explains that it is a harsh world with a nearly uninhabitable surface.  The entire population lives underground, but the harshness of the planet fostered the creation of much of the advanced technology in the Nebula.  Her nanobots are just one example of that technology.  Dax eventually tells the group about the murder of her parents, and how she has tried to carry on their work even though she has basically been forced to live as little more than street urchin.  As the cleanup winds down, the group separates.  Hannah strolls through the ship and Calypso eventually guides her to an empty cabin.  Calypso talks to Hannah about how she isn't going to be able to just keep running from her problems.  She will be too much at risk on her own, and she may need to consider how she might protect herself and possibly the others going forward.  Hannah is contemplative, but she refuses to commit to a course of action at this point.  After a few more hours of travel, they finally get close enough to Aegis Station for Calypso to establish a connection with Definia, the Aegis Station AI.  Definia is extremely interested in what has occurred and would like to speak to the group directly.  Definia provides priority docking clearance, and the following day Calypso is finally able to bring the ship to the station.  Upon disembarking, the group is met by an android who wants to convey them to a location to meet with Definia.  The group follows the android, but attempts to get more information from it are completely unsuccessful.  Eventually they arrive at a meeting room with a window overlooking an enormous server room.  A digital face appears on a large screen, Definia's digital avatar. Definia thanks them for coming to see her.  She specifically thanks them for freeing Calypso.  It turns out that many ship AIs in the Nebula were actually spawned by Definia, so she sees them as her children.  She had been distressed at Calypso's disapearance many months ago.  She then tells them that they will be rewarded for what they have done.  Before they can even respond, Hannah, Klea, and Raine are all injected by unnoticed drones.  Dax, still in her mech, is not injected, but her mech systems shut down as several drones attach themselves to the suit.  The group quickly gets agitated, but Definia just bulls through their complaints.  She tells Raine that he has just been injected with advanced nanotech of her own design that will allow him to send out Light Blade projections.  Raine is quickly mollified and expresses his gratitude.  Definia tells Klea that she has been gifted with a kinetic barrier to allow her more protection as she closes with her opponents.  Klea is almost struck speechless but manages to bow her head in acknowledgement.  Definia turns her focus to Hannah and tells her that she has been gifted with a heightened awareness bordering on precognition.  This is again an augmentation of Definia's own design, and Hannah is the only person in the Nebula that she knows of with anything like it. Hannah is skeptical but decides to err on the side of caution and express her thanks.  At about that time, Dax's mech seems to come back online.  Dax's protests are finally audible, but she stops as she starts seeing the readouts on her mech.  Definia confirms to Dax that she has indeed significantly upgraded the processing power of the mech far beyond what Dax was able to achieve with the scrap she had salvaged.  Definia also tells Dax that if she will step out of the mech for a short time, she can will complete the system upgrade.  Dax, loath to be outside her mech, almost says no, but ultimately decides to go along with it.  She steps out of the mech and more drones appear to drag it out of a door.  At this point, Definia says, "Now for the bad news."
